I usually use Beautiful SOUP to do automation on HTML and Javascript automation but here it is.

Assuming you have python 3 and pip installed

To start please check your google chrome web browser version and download the driver 
I have added my own driver for organization purposes.

Once you have done this, please replace your webdriver with mine.

Cd into this directory and enter the cmd
Pip install -r requirements.txt

Afterwards if it is successful, you can run

Python3 main.py 



Notes:

Any errors will be populated in a log file in the same directory when you run main.py and not in the console

I have added this so that we can capture the stack trace much easier and also the method culprit


This is assuming that you have chrome installed
